Setup AWS Glue:

Go to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console.
Set up a crawler to crawl your data source (e.g., an S3 bucket) and create a data catalog.
Create a Glue job to perform the ETL operations.
Lambda Trigger:

Set up an S3 event trigger on the bucket containing your source data. 
This trigger will invoke a Lambda function whenever new data is uploaded.
Lambda Function:

Your Lambda function will be triggered by the S3 event and will start the Glue job.
Here's an example of how your Lambda function might look:
'''
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    glue = boto3.client('glue')
    job_name = 'your-glue-job-name'
    
    try:
        response = glue.start_job_run(JobName=job_name)
        job_run_id = response['JobRunId']
        print(f"Started Glue job run with ID: {job_run_id}")
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': f"Started Glue job run with ID: {job_run_id}"
        }
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error starting Glue job: {e}")
        return {
            'statusCode': 500,
            'body': f"Error starting Glue job: {e}"
        }

'''
Glue Job:
Your Glue job will define the ETL process, including the extraction, transformation, and loading of data.
Write your ETL script using PySpark in the Glue job script editor.
'''
import sys
from awsglue.transforms import *
from awsglue.utils import getResolvedOptions
from pyspark.context import SparkContext
from awsglue.context import GlueContext
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

glueContext = GlueContext(SparkContext.getOrCreate())
spark = glueContext.spark_session

# Extract data
datasource0 = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_catalog(database = "your_database", table_name = "your_table")

# Transform data
# Example transformation - converting column 'name' to uppercase
transformed_data = ApplyMapping.apply(frame = datasource0, mappings = [("name", "string", "name", "string")], transformation_ctx = "transformed_data")

# Load data
glueContext.write_dynamic_frame.from_options(frame = transformed_data, connection_type = "s3", connection_options = {"path": "s3://your-bucket/output"}, format = "parquet")

job.commit()

'''
Replace 'your-glue-job-name', 'your_database', 'your_table', and 
's3://your-bucket/output' with your actual Glue job name, database name, 
table name, and S3 output path respectively.

This setup allows you to automate the ETL process using AWS Lambda 
triggers to start AWS Glue jobs, providing a scalable and serverless 
solution for your ETL pipeline.

Note:
In the Glue job script provided, we are not using the .upper() method 
explicitly to convert the values in the 'name' column to uppercase. 
Instead, we are using the ApplyMapping transformation to map the 
'name' column to a new column with the same name, effectively overwriting it. 
However, in the mapping, we're not performing any transformation to the data.

In AWS Glue, a DynamicFrame is a high-level data structure that represents 
distributed collection of data. It's designed to handle both structured 
and semi-structured data, making it versatile for various data processing tasks.
